For the encryption program Step 1 & Step 2 - 
The two files the credentials.c and the encryption.c are required to store at the same foolder before using the programs.
The file credentials.c must be run before the encryption.c as the first file creates the username and password for the second program, then the encryption.c can be used.
For changing the the credentials of the enryption program, the credentials.c file can be run again.

For simple encryption program - 
The program simple_encrytion can be used normally. The password can be changed inside the program which are marked with comments.

For Stack -
All the basic opertaions on a stack are shown here.

For Queue -
All the basic opertaions on a queue are shown here.

For Singly linked List program - 
In this program almost all the basic operations to be performed on a singly linked list are shown.

For Doubly linked List program - 
In this program almost all the basic operations to be performed on a doubly linked list are shown.

Note -
This is an experimental code with the basic knowledge of c language.
All the codes are properly working but on the basic level only.
